UMPD Crime Data Analysis --> https://ybencheq.github.io

This analysis was based on the crime data provided by the University of Maryland's Police Department website. Our purpose was to analyze UMD crime data from 2013 to 2017 to better inform the public of the highest frequency crimes, their typical hour of occurrences and their most common locations on campus. In addition, this data could be sufficient in noticing correlated trends and thus may assist in predicting future occurrences, their times and their locations.
